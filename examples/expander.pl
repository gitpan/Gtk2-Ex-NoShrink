# This is an automated demo of the noshrink policy.  The text of a label
# widget is set to a run of stars "****" growing and shrinking on a timer.
# The changing text makes the label ask to be bigger and smaller, but the
# NoShrink widget keeps it at its peak size.
#
# The label is setup as white text on a black background, and that can be
# seen growing into space provided by a GtkLayout widget (with a white
# background).
#
# The "xalign" property is set to 0 in the label to have the text aligned at
# the left when the space is more than the text needs.  You can change that
# to say 1.0 to have it aligned at the right -- the no-shrink policy remains
# the same.
#
# If you're wondering what the EventBox is for, it just gives a different
# background colour for the label.  A label is a no-window widget (and
# NoShrink is a no-window too) and hence gets the background of its parent,
# put it in something with a window to have a background colour contrasting
# against the layout parent.
