Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink is a simple container widget imposing a "no shrink"
policy on the size requested by its child.  If the child asks to
become smaller then that request is ignored, rather the child's
largest-ever request is used.

The actual size the NoShrink gets, and in turn gives its child,
depends on the further higher widget parents.  For forms or tables
where size requests provoke a re-layout the NoShrink can stop
pointlessly small wobbles, or if the child's desired size is
data-dependent but too hard to calculate in advance then it can let
the child reach a peak and then maintain that.

The only prerequisite is Gtk2-Perl itself.  The NoShrink home page is
