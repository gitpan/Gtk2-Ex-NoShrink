=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink -- non-shrinking container widget

=for test_synopsis my ($my_child_widget)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink;
 my $noshrink = Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink->new;
 $noshrink->add ($my_child_widget);

=head1 WIDGET HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::Bin>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Container
        Gtk2::Bin
          Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink> container widget holds a single child widget and
imposes a "no shrink" policy on its size.  The child can grow, but any
request to shrink is ignored.

When the child requests a size the NoShrink sets that as the size it
requests in turn from its parent.  If the child later changes asks to be
smaller, the NoShrink stays at the previous larger size, thus keeping the
child's largest-ever request.  A largest size is maintained separately for
width and for height.

Requested sizes are of course just that: only requests.  It's a matter for
the NoShrink's parent how much space is actually provided.  The NoShink
always sets its child to the full allocated space, less the usual
C<border-width> (see L<Gtk2::Container>) if that's set.  As usual it's then
a matter for the child what it does in a size perhaps bigger or perhaps
smaller than what it said it wanted.

If a child is added but not shown (no C<< $child->show >>) then it's treated
as if there was no child.  This is the same as other container classes do.
For NoShrink it means a size request of the C<minimum-width> by
C<minimum-height>, plus C<border-width>, and nothing drawn.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink->new (key=>value,...) >>

Create and return a new C<Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink> container widget.  Optional
key/value pairs set initial properties per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

    my $noshrink = Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink->new (border_width => 4);

The child widget can be set with the usual container C<add> method,

    $noshrink->add ($my_child_widget);

Or with the usual C<child> pseudo-property, either at creation time or
later,

    my $noshrink = Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink->new
                     (child => $my_child_widget);

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<minimum-width> (integer, default 0)

=item C<minimum-height> (integer, default 0)

The currently accumulated minimum width and height to impose on the size
request made by the child.  These are maintained as the largest width and
height requested from the child so far, or 0 for no size requested in that
direction so far.

Both sizes are for the child's space.  Any C<border-width> amount is added
on top of these for the size requested in turn by the NoShrink to its
parent.

These minimums can be set initially to begin at a particular size,

    my $noshrink = Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink->new (minimum_width => 30,
                                            minimum_height => 20);

They can also be reduced later to reset the size.  This results in the
greater of the new value or the child's current requested size.  Setting 0
for instance always goes to the child's current requested size.  This is
good if the nature of the child's content has changed,

    $noshrink->set('minimum-width', 0);  # reset to child size

These minimum size properties are unaffected by any removal of the child
widget or re-add of a new child.  If a new widget has a completely different
nature then you may want to reset both dimensions to start again from its
new sizes.

=item C<shrink-width-factor> (float, default 0)

=item C<shrink-height-factor> (float, default 0)

If non-zero then these values are factors representing a point at which the
NoShrink will in fact shrink to match the child's size.

If the child asks for a width which is a factor C<shrink-width-factor> (or
more) smaller than the existing C<minimum-width> imposed, then the
C<NoShrink> will reset the C<minimum-width> to the child's request.
Likewise C<shrink-height-factor> on the height.

Suppose for instance C<shrink-width-factor> is 2.0 and the NoShrink has over
the course of successive child requests grown to 300 pixels wide.  If the
child then asks to be 100 pixels the NoShrink will obey that, because it's a
shrinkage by a factor more than 2.0 times.  The new C<minimum-width> becomes
100.

These factors allow small shrinks to be ignored but large ones obeyed.  This
is good if the child might grow to a silly size when displaying wild data
for a while and you'd like it to shrink back when normality is restored.

=back

The usual C<border-width> property from C<Gtk2::Container> is followed.  It
leaves a border of that many pixels around the child in the C<NoShrink>
container's allocated space.  Currently nothing is drawn in the border.  The
default C<border-width> is 0, giving the child all the allocated space.
