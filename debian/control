Description: Non-shrinking container widget for Gtk2-Perl
 Gtk2::Ex::NoShrink holds a single child and imposes a "no shrink"
 policy on the size it requests.  Any request to become smaller is
 ignored, rather its largest-ever requested size is used.
 .
 This is good if small amounts of shrinking cause distracting
 re-layout, or if a widget's actual desired size is data-dependent and
 can't be easily calculated in advance (but will quickly reach a peak
 you'd like it to stick at).
